## Design Process
  ### Steps
  - Understand: Look all about the product context and find insights.
  - Define: Filter the information that was found, refocused thinking what really it will lead to the goal.
  - Make: Create the product using the information selected.
  - Launch: Launch the product and oversee the user's review, restart the process in interactive way.

  ### Pillars
  - Empathy: The capicity of , tools: personas, etnography research
  - Colaborate: types: informative, consultive, co-create, participatory
  - Experiment: Test over development, launch the product same that not be complete.

  ### Interface Project
  - Surface: Design sensorial
  - Backbone: Design de interface, navegation and information
  - Structure: Interation design, archteture
  - Scope: Functional requirements, inded requirement
  - Strategy: User requirements, product goal

  ### Why understand the user
  - Project personalized solutions.
  - Predict the experience with the product.
  - What the users want may not be they needs.
  - What the benefit of the product to the user? Focus on what increase value.
  - To understand the value cycle 

  ### How understand the user

  ### Nielsen Heuristics
  
  1.Visibility of system status: The user needs to know in real time the status of the system, for example: the system is loading the new page, the solicitation can't be used, the end of the page, the next step is...
  
  2.Match between the system and real world: the symbols, layouts, graphics interfaces and aplication should have relation with real objects for that the user can know the mean of it.  
  
  3.User control and freedom: The user should have possibilites to control your navegation in the system, for example: exit, back, roll, write, delete... If don't possible execute some function the information about it must be clearly.
  
  4.Consistency and standards: Design new pattern can be a possibility to have a  full original product but it can confuse the user, then is necessarily know the patterns for the differents aplications, the use of it optimize the development and can make a easy to use system. 
  
  5.Error Prevention: The interface should predict all possible actions that the user can execute and make mechanisms to prevent mistakes.
  
  6.Recognition rather than recall: The people have more facility in recognition instead to memorize, then create interfaces that help they to detect patterns.
  
  7.Flexibility and effiency of use: Flexible process can be carried out in different ways, so that people can pick wichever methods works for them, for example: the action of copy a text can be execute by mouse click over the selected text or using the keys ctrl+c.
  
  8.Aesthetic and minimalist design: The interface should not contain which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra information competes with the relevant information, the UI should be focused in primary goals, for more information result in more doubts.
  
  9. Help users to recognize, diagnose and recover from errors: When a error can't be prevented the user should be helped to understand it and how to correct it, for example: when the user complete a field with the incorrect format of text or numbers, this situations can be solved in three steps: 1. Inform user when an error has ocurred, 2. Tell users what went wrong, 3. Offer users a solution.

  10. Help & Documentation: The ideal is system's doesn't needed aditional information, but the designer should think in the event of user error and can develope help and documentation in many different forms, but must be: 1. Easy to search, 2. Focused on the user's task 3. List concrete step to be carried out.

  ### Design system and style guides
  - Design system is a group of pre-built standards, icons, symbols and layouts that help to make interfaces with more agility, consistence and brand identification.
