## 1. Requirements

### What's requirements?

- All clients want a dream software that is made fast with high quality and launches all wishes, but in project management the relation among time, cost, and scope is represented by a triangule that this three topics are hard-linked, then when the time is short and the scope is great the cost will increase. The scope of a project can be defined as a list of requirements, and requirements can be defined as a service, aplications, interface, tecnology or any components wished or necessary in the product idealized by the client.

  - Some requirements are:
    - A type of interface design
    - A strategy of data security
    - Acess velocity
    - Capacity of users sametime
    - How the devices will be conected
    - Email resources
    - Data analytics
    - API's


### Type of requirements

  - There are a lot of classifications of requirementes types, the most usually are:

  - Functional and Non-Functional Requirements:
    - Functional: are the actions that the systems should execute, without considering physical restrictions, for example:
       - The system should allow the administrator manage the users register.
       - The system should allow the Manager to see all borrowings carried out in the month, show the employee that provide it, the client that receive it and the value credited.

    - Non-Functional: are refer to quality and performance based requirements, describe the system attributes, for example:
       - The system database should be storage in MySQL.
       - The system can suport 40 million users.
    
  - Clients and System Requirements:
    - Clients: refer to what the client want in the software idealized, describe the troubles faced by users, characteristics of the solutions wished. For example:
      - Design of the interface
      - What are the methods of payment in an e-commerce
      - Data analytics
      - API's

    - System: refer to the back-end structure that is necessary to run the clients requirements, for example:
      - What's the technology to store data
      - What are the protocols used in the comunications networks
      - What's the processor performance is necessary
        
    
  ### Why know well the requirements?
    - It's necessary to know what is wished for making a way to it
    - The client should be satisfied with the system
