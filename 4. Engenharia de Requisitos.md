## 1. Requirements

  ### What's requirements?

  - All clients want a dream software that is made fast with high quality and launches all wishes, but in project management the relation among time, cost, and scope is represented by a triangule that this three topics are hard-linked, then when the time is short and the scope is great the cost will increase. The scope of a project can be defined as a overview of the list of requirements, and requirements can be defined as a service, aplications, interface, tecnology or any components wished or necessary in the product idealized by the client.

  - Some requirements are:
    - A type of interface design
    - A strategy of data security
    - Acess velocity
    - Capacity of users sametime
    - How the devices will be conected
    - Email resources
    - Data analytics
    - API's


  ### Type of requirements

  - There are a lot of classifications of requirementes types, the most usually are:

  - Functional and Non-Functional Requirements:
    - Functional: are the actions that the systems should execute, without considering physical restrictions, for example:
       - The system should allow the administrator manage the users register.
       - The system should allow the Manager to see all borrowings carried out in the month, show the employee that provide it, the client that receive it and the value credited.

    - Non-Functional: are refer to quality and performance based requirements, describe the system attributes, for example:
       - The system database should be storage in MySQL.
       - The system can suport 40 million users.
    
  - Clients and System Requirements:
    - Clients: refer to what the client want in the software idealized, describe the troubles faced by users, characteristics of the solutions wished. For example:
      - Design of the interface
      - What are the methods of payment in an e-commerce
      - Data analytics
      - API's

    - System: refer to the back-end structure that is necessary to run the clients requirements, for example:
      - What's the technology to store data
      - What are the protocols used in the comunications networks
      - What's the processor performance is necessary
        
    
 ### Why know well the requirements?

   - It's necessary to know clearly what's the clients want, then making a way to it.
   - The client should be satisfied with the system.
   - A system can became impossible.
   - Wrong requirements can cause low quality systems, delay to launch

## Requirements Engineering

  - The importance of the requirements in software projects made developed the knowledge about it, this topic become an Engineering field defined as a group of processes used to elicitation, analysis, specification, validation, and management the requirements of the software.

  ### Elicitation 
  - This activity can be defined as the researching and discovering the requirements starting from the sources, considering the clients necessities, expectations, and restrictions.

  - Steps to elicitation requirements:
    1. List all information from the client idea
    2. Ask the customer, users and others what the objectives for the system or product are
    3. Define the source of requirements
    4. Raise the requirements

  - Some problems can be occurred:
    1. Problems of scope - The informations are confuse or incomplete
    2. Problems of understanding - The customers/users are not completely sure of what is needed
    3. Problems of volatility - The requirements often changes

  - Some approaches:
    1. Visualization - Use graphic tool to promote a better undestanding of the desired end-product
    2. Consistent language - Simple and short descriptions, using natural language
    3. Guidelines - Create and follow organizational guidelines
    4. Consistent use of templates - Models and templates to document the requirements
    5. Documenting dependencies - Documenting dependencies and interrelationships among requirements
    6. Analysis of changes - Analyze the root cause of the changes and make corrective actions

  - Negociation and Priorization:
    - After the elicitation is necessary to analyze the requirements to discovering possible conflicts among them, if exist it what to do?
    - The IEEE group the requirements in three level of importance:
    1. Essential: the software is unacceptable without this
    2. Conditional: the implementation of this increase value to the software
    3. Optional: can be or not implemented considring the time and resources available

  ### Analysis and Detail

  Object Oriented Analysis - focused in modelling the concepts of product domain, your 

  Actor - Extern elementer that interact with the system, for example: people, organization, other systems, equipaments. It's not a specific person but the role of someone that can become a user

  - User Case
  It's a tecnique used for describe a system funcitionality, made a conceitual model of the system, group the requirements in logical units, sequence of actions that return a result
  Full road in actor view
  What the goal of the system?
  Link between actor and actions

  Event: Phares in active voice describing the actions
  
  - Diagrams: Defined the basic events flow, for example:

  - Pré-Conditions: Show the sequence of the actions, the requirements are necessary before to start the user case or event.

  - Pós-Conditions: What must be do after the action, for example: save the informations gathered

  - Events Flow: step by step of the actions

  - Mainly Flow: It's one, consider that ations has sucessfull

  - Alternative Flow:

  - Sub Flow: In case of repeatition of event flow, it can be separate in other flow and linked with the events.

  - Business Rules: Detailed procediments and guides that drive the system, mainly used in complex events.
