# **Software Engineer in Digital Transformation**

## 1. Summary of history of computing and society

  ### Why did we began developed the computers?
  
  The aritmetics operations ever were presente in the life of humans, it's is a basic result of our cognition. In the past were used primary tecniques to adition, subtraction, divison and multiplication, for example: shepherds counted the herd of yours animals drawing lines in a piece of wood and the abacos maked in the ground that were used by babylon and romans. Over time with the developed of sciences has became necessary to do advanced calculations, improve the comunication and store of information, for this has created a lot of calculatores machines and the first computers. Below there are some topics and machines that was developed in the history of computer tecnology or "information tecnology (IT)".
      
  ### Silogisms:
  For understanded and define the logic conditional and conjunct theory was created the concept of Silogism, it's a logic expressions such as: "If all X are Y and all Y are Z, then all X are Z", don't matters what is X, Y and Z, the logic is true.

  ### Algorithms:
  To do adition and division of longers numbers the mathetic Abdullah Muhammad bin Musa al-Khwarizmi has developed a step by step, this procediment was named "Algorithm", over time this concept became a important topics of computer science called "Data structure and Algoritms", because the scientists saw that similar problems has a similar solutions and with the creation and analyse of algoritms could help to find the best solutions. 

  ### Criptography
  Although the term "criptography" has made in 1920 year, a lot of years before this the mathematic Al-Kindi (from Iraque) post a papper about decoding criptograph messages. In this texto he describe a method based in frequency of letters in a text. For example: in longs texts the letter "A" represent on average 14,63% of all letters, then if a simbol appear in this frequency have a great probability to be this letter.
  Over time this topic became a very important because is a efficient method to improve data security in information tecnology, many techniques was developed from simples as: substitute the letter by your next in alphabethic, to equations non linear for calculate the index position of a letter.  

  ### Automatos
  The word "automato" mean originaly describe a machine able to move without eletricity, especially that made actions that remember humans or animals, a famous example is in the movie "Hugo" based in the book "The invention of Hugo Cabret". In the theory of computer the aumatos is defined as matematic model of a machine of finite states, this topic is very import for study computational possibilities and complexity.
  
  ### Charles Babbage
  Borned in England at 1791 this cientist is known as a inventor that was project the first computer for generally use, made only with mechanical parts, named "Analytical Machine", this equipament were based in mechanical tear made by the frech Jacquard that were able to read drilled cards with instructions. Although of all their idea never was made because was necessity of techniques over advanced for that time. Over time some details of the project was lost, impossibility the done. 
  
  ### Ada Lovelace
  Interested in the idea of "Analytical Machine" this mathematic and writter english studied their operation and developed the first algoritms that allowed the machine compute the values of mathematic functions. She is know as "the first computer programmer".

  ### Herman Hollerit
  With the development of tecnology of drilleds cards this north-american employeer boost your use for registry and read informations about the populational census, for this he invented a machine able to read this card in BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) code, this invent became essentialy to input information in computers.  

  ### IBM
  The International Business Machine (IBM) appear at 1924 manufacturing mechanical machines of tabuletes with the model created by hollerit, won a big contract with EUA government for produce machines able to register informations about the american workers. After some years joined in industry of writter machines. Over time this company developed many products that the objective were purpose otimization daily tasks of other companies, at 1960 has launched your first eletronic computer named "RAMA 305", after this the company focused in developement of hardware and software for personal and enterprise computers. In the most recent years the IBM transformed your business model leaving of production of hardware and begans in the market of products of information tecnology, providing services for many big companies around the world.  

  ### Turing Machine
 This a teoric model of machine able to show a basic concept of computer operation, this has devoped when Alan Turing look a way of explain how to human reasoning execute mathematical calculus through of a formal system, he defined that consist on a serie of operation for transform numbers in a serie of states that move on by fixed rules up to result. The mechanism is compost of a device fixed in a moveable head that could go to left or right and able to write and erase symbols in a infinite tape, the tape is partitioned in equal parts, a control unit could read a list of instructions of what do, the part readed is named "state", the salphabetic of symbols should be finite. Few years after the publication of th papper that described this equipament the mathematic and scientists of computer defined: "any operation only can be execute by any computer if was abled executed by Turing Machine"
 
  ### Teste de Turing
  The "Turing Test" test the capicty of a machine of show a human inteligence, or indistinguishable this. The ilustrator example thinked by Turing is the situation: a human player join in a talk with other human and a machine, all players are so far among their, the humans makes questions, if they couldn't identify who replied,the machine was approved.  
 
  ### Eniac
  When the EUA join in the Second World War the American Army request to Moore School in Pensilvânia the work of calculate the trajectory of missils, this service generated tables with the information for each gun, however the manufactures produced many new models of guns and the manual work were very slow than they needs, the students John Machly and John Eckert began developed a project of eletronic machine able to execute this work very fast, it used eletronic valves to substitute the mechanical parts. This project named "ENIAC" was financed by Amarican Army but has done only in few months after the war, it were compost of 17.468 valves, 1500 relays, 70.000 resistors and 10.000 capacitors, stayed in a room of 10x15 meters, weighed 30 ton and your power consumption were 174 KW, this computer was could execute a calculus equivalent of the 50 mil people, a simple trajectory was calculated in 20 hours for a table calculator, 15 minutes for a differential analyzer, could be executed at 20 second by the ENIAC.
  
  ### Transistor
  The first computers used eletromechanic valves for compute, it were big and heavy, the transistor is a semiconductor device that fuction as eletronic valve can be control the voltage and current, it's a too small and light, through it became possible develope better computers. It's made mainly by silicon, this material gave name to principal place of developing of hardware and sorftware of world the "Silicon Valley".

  ### Arquitetura de Vonn Neumann
  After the build of ENIAC Mauchly e Eckert began the EDVAC project, that had a binary memory and more capacity than ENIAC. Those cientists invited John Von Neumann to participe of development of this computer, the archteture projected to EDVAC were based in four parts: memory, control unit, unit of logic and arithmetic (ULA) and input/output interfaces. This archteture inspire and are used the most of computers now and wsa nammed "Von Neumann Archteture"
    

## The first Age (1950 - 1960)
  ### IBM 701
  At 1952 the IBM launched the considered your first cientific comercial computer, the system used eletrostatic stored, that gave a memory of 2048 words of 36 bits each, went used for weather forecast.
  
  ### Fortran
  The programing language Fortran was developed to computer IBM 704 at 1954 and was very used by cientist in writing of heavy numeric programs, became a popular language in the cientific community because has a lot of compilers, in addition were simple and easy to learn and could work with complex numbers. Now in 2021 it's still the 20º popularity programing language of the world.
  
  ### Algol
  The programing language ALGOL was invented at 1950 by a group of computer cientists from america and europe. It's a high level language and was very used by academic community but won't by the enterprises.
  
## The second Age (1960 - 1970)

  ### Circuito Integrado
  With the use of transistor replacing the eletromechnic valve the industry of computers has a great advance, however over time the demand of machine more and more powerful growed and the builders finded dificculties to make big circuits with wires and a lot of transistors, then Robert Noyce and Jack Kilby thinked in a way of conect this devices in compact and solid object, they developed in independent ways differents devices but the companies for they works began a judicial proceeding to obtain the patent of integrated circuit.
  
  ### Cobol
  The Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL) began developed in 1959 by a team of cientist, companies and users of computers with the goal to create a common language for business, after few months and a lot of discussions was defined that the programs had three divisions: data, procedures and environment, for can be executed in diferents hardware. In 1960 was done the first compilers and for first time the same program was worked in diferents computers of diferents manufactures.
  
  ### Mouse
  Looking a way for comunicated to computer commands of manipulation of objects that were on screen Douglas Engebart developed the device able to move in two axis a arrow present in the user interface, because of your box form with a wire conected in back was named "Mouse".
  
  ### Package Switching
  The development of software requires more and more capacity of transmission and store data, for transport data with productivity and reliability news ways had created, in 1967 Davies and Baran developed the tecnology "package switching" that group the data in packets and send it in many roads, if one route was broken or busy other route were used to delivery to the destination.
  
  ### Microprocessor
  With the created of integrated circuits in 1960 a lot of companies started the imagine the possibility to integrated in a one part all the circuits of the central processor unit (CPU), the first project used one static memory (ROM), dinamic memory (RAM), Input and Output processor and a microprocessor of 4 bits. 
  
## The third Age (1970 - 1980)

  ### Banco de dados relacionais
  The necessity of storage a lot of data required new methods and tecnologies to organize it, the "Relational Banks of Data" used table with lines and coluns and was created to increase simplicity for execute the operations with data, the principal creator Edgar F. Codd listed 13 rules to the data bank be consider relational.
  
  ### Unix
  In 1965 was formed a team of programers include Ken Thompson, Dennis ritchie, Douglas Mcllrou and Peter Weiner for develope a operational system named "Multics" that should be a system with time shared for a big users community, few months after because of problems among the team and the companies. In 1969 Ken Thompson restarted to writing the Multidics and was named now "Unix", in 1973 when Dennis Ritchie and Ken re-writed the system using C language trying to make a universal system for diferents hardwares. Over time it was developed and became one of most popular and important system of the world, it kernel is used by a lot of popular O.S now.
  
  ### Ethernet / TCP IP / Internet
  For two computers achieved comunicated is necessary that define a protocol of comunication, in 1974 Vinton Cerf and Robert Elliot created the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) based in four principles: network conectivity, distributed, recovery data, can't modified for conection. Actually it's the most protocol used in world networks.
  
  ### Apple I /II
  In 1976 Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak maked a micrcomputer with a microprocessor MOS 6502, Wozniak used worn eletronic boards to the first prototype, Jobs sold 50 samples to "The Byte Shop", the Apple I was had a advantage for concurrents, it could be conect to a usual TV, other microcomputers was neededs of special monitors or only light some lamps. After this they developed the Apple II and over time the companie became one of bigger of the world.
   
## The fourth Age (1980 - 2000)

  ### MS - DOS
  The Microsoft Disk Operating system is a operational system purchased by Microsoft for to be used in product line IBM PC. Before it belong the Microsoft were named "QDOS" and belonged to Seattle Computer Systems, in 1980 the IBM company looked a operational system for your new personal computer, then they consult Bill Gates to developed this in BASIC language but he recomended the CP/M system that was developed by Digital Research for 8086 Intel processor, but the negociation was not done, few months after the microsoft purchased the QDOS and optimize it, maked a contract with IBM which foresaw the receveir royalties for each IBM PC bought. This OS is consider the cause of growed up the Microsft Company.
   
  ### Sun Microsystems
  Founded in 1982 was a company focused in computer on networks, looked developed products of hardware and software that work in networks with big graphics capacity, known by distribute open source software, in 1990 maked the language "Java", that became one of most popular of the world, also developed a lot of software to compete wtih the Microsoft, it bought the developer of MySQL and few times after open the product to free, what seemed cause financial loss made the company became biggest. In 2009 was bought to Oracle.
  
  ### GNU
  In 1971 Richard M Stallman started work in AI Laboratorie at MIT and became part of "hackers" comunnity that shared and developed. They believed that every software should be shared, but after few years the comunnity fall out because the most of programs developed was writing in PDP-11 and it was discontinued. Stallman were decided to developed Free Softwares, for this was necessary attend to four requirements:
  
  - The Freedom to run the program as you wish.
  - The Freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Acess to the source code is a precondition for this.
  - The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.
  - The Freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give a whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Acess to the source code is a precondition for this.

The concepts of "Free Software" and "Open source" are too important and are debated many times by the comunity, all agree that this philosophy was very important for software development in the history.

  ### MAC OS
  
  Developed for the Macintosh Computer this operational system was the star of this product, it interface was totally graphics, had windows to organize the aplication on the screen, some problems were detected for users what made the Apple lauched a new version few months after the start-up. The most of users like the new way of execute commands and run the programs.
   
  ### Windows
  
 With the wish of the users by graphics interfaces in the 1985 the Microsft developed the operational system "Windows", initially the purpose was only a interface to MS-DOS but over time this system became very popular, new versions was lauched and new functions were added, the facility and interactivity of GUI made this system user-friendly. The use of GUI upgrade the hardware requiriments to run without lags and bugs, but the hardware was developing more fast than software. 
 
  ### The World Wide Web (WWW)
  The developed of Internet made grow up some ideas to made easy the shared of documents and data. In 1989 Tim Berners-Lee writed a method to manegement the data comunication that refer the "ENQUIRE" and describe a more complex system, with Robert Cailliau in 1990 they launched the formal standart for the World Wide Web. Lee was builded the core parts of this system: the browser, server and the first Web pages. The Web link the user to a page stored in a serve through hipertext, the user request the information through of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URL), this is a address standart, the conection is founded then a HTTP requisition is sended and the comunication was made using the HTML language, the browser reder the information to user screen. 
  
  ### Linux
  The kernel Linux  was writed by Linus Torvalds in 1991, he wish make a free version of MINIX operational system, in same time Richard Stallman was developing the GNU Project that had the goal to develope free softwares based in the GNU/GPL license but it's no had a good kernel, then in 1992 the license of Linux has change to GNU/GPL what allowed a lot of developers contribute with this system helped it to be the most popular kernel with the professional users and aplications now.
  
  ### Google
  The search engine Google was started in 1996 by the students of Stanford University Larry Page and Sergey Brin, seeing that the traditionals search engines not used a good method, they developed a new tool name "BackRub" because it checked backlinks to estimate the priority of a site, after changed the name to Google because a orthographic error in the written of the word "googol" that mean a number sucessive with hundred zeros. The company was founded in 1998 and after extern investiments quickly expanded, adquired a lot of technology companies and now is the biggest company of the world, it's revenue is majoritary from the service of digital marketing.
  
  ### Wi-Fi
  For the use of radiofrequency tecnology is necessary government autorizations i the most of countrys in the world, the Federal Communications Commision has defined a standard to use this tecnology to conected devices to internet, it allow the use of 900 MHz, 2,4 GHZ and 5,8 GHz band, it was named "trash frequencies", however the manufactures don't risked because the comunications standard not were good defined. Based in the Ethernet protocol the IEEE developed the standards IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.11b, but it was  too complexity, in 1999 a lot of technology companies founded the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (Wi-Fi) to finally standardized this tecnology.

  
## The fifth Age (2000 - Now)

  ### Social Networks
  With the popularization of internet was made aplications to conected people to shared their lifes, named "Social Networks" became one of most popular aplications in the internet, people around all the world could be talk, shared photos, videos and ideas with any people in anywhere of the world. Now the use of this aplication have caused many discussions about socialization and mental health.
  
  ### Smartphone
  The development of microeletronic enable to make small computers, the cellphone that used to talk become a pocket computer with all function that a desktop can make.
  
  ### Digital Transformation of Society
  The use of digital technology allows the human solutions many problems and offer a lot of services to all areas, the presence of digital computers in the most actions of the peoples in modern society are turning the way and possibilietes of the actions, this is named "Digital Transformation" and are being discussion of the consequences those modifications in the world.
  
 
# 2. Basic Concepts
  ### What's the concept of software?
  The formal defition can be "List of instructions that when executed return informations, functions and performance wished", but the real concept is too abragent to seemed, software can be a product and a way of promotion for other software, it's not wear product, also can be defined as "The logic instructions writed throug escific language to control a machine to do operations and return results". 
  
  ### What's software engine
  The software engineering can be defined as "The aplication of a approach systematic, disciplined and measured in the development, operation and maintenance of software."

  ### Myths of projects of software

  #### Management
  - If we have a book that suported software development, this is enough to can help developers?
  - If the scheduling delayed, we can be add more promgrammers and willbe just in time.
  - Outsource the project is the better option.

  #### Clients
  - A general definition of the goals is enough. Uma definição geral dos objetivos é o suficiente
  - The requirements change over time, but can be easily assimilated. Os requisitos mudam continuamente, mas podem ser facilmente assimiladas.

  #### Software professionals
  - When the program was done and running, the work has done.
  - Until the programs will be working, has not way to avaliate it quality. 
  - Only product that can be submited is the program in running. 
  - The software engineer will make the desnecessary documentations. 

# 3. Process of software
  ### A process of software is a methodology with actions and tasks necessary to develope a high quality software. A model of this concept set five activities:
  
  ## Comunication
  The comunications is so much important for evething we do, in process of software it was set as the task necessary to compile all important informations to started the project.
  
  ## Planning
  After the knowed the principally informations is necessary create a plan that draw a road to the goal.
  
  ## Modeling
  Also is very important define the basic model of the product, it can be modified when are used interative methods.
  
  ## Building
  Then the team knowed the key informations, the model and road to the product, now is ready to started to building.
  
  ## Submit
  When the basic functions were ready the first version of the software can be deliver to the client, over time naturally new modifications can be requested.

## Prescriptive Model
  The prescriptive models of software defined a group of elements and work flow predictable, the goal is organize a basic reference.some model was defined:
  
  ### Waterfall
  This model is partitioned in step by step flow, for you can execute the next task will need done the previous, it reduce the risk of the project but add more burocracy. 
  
  ### Incremental
  In this model the tasks of each step were partitioned in versions and when done a version, the cycle of sequence of tasks restarted.
  
  ### Evolutionary
  Is similar the Incremental method, it flow can be represented by a coil of activities.
  
  ### Concurrency
  In this model the activities of process software can be executed in same time, the project will evolute more fast but problems can appear because some requirements can't be add after some steps.


  ### Unified Process (UML)
  
  ### IBM RUP
  - Dirigido por caso de uso
  RUP: Concepção -> Elaboração -> Construção -> Transição


  ### Reengenharia de Processos de Software
  Leis de Lehman:
  - Lei da Mudança Continua
  - Lei da Complexidade Crescente
  - Lei da Autorregulação
  - Lei da Conservação da Estabilidade Organizacional
  - Lei da Conservação da Familiaridade
  - Lei do Crescimento Contínuo
  - Lei da Qualidade em Declínio
  - Lei do Sistema de Realimentação.


# 4.Inovation
  ### What mean Inovation?
  ### What's not inovation
  ### When we need innovate?
  ### Inovation Ecosytems
  Benefits of stay in this ambient:
  - Trade of experiencies
  - "Reconhecimento" by the community
