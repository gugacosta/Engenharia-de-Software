## 1. Summary of history of computing and society

  ### Why did we began developed the computers?
  
  The aritmetics operations ever were presente in the life of humans, it's is a basic result of our cognition. In the past were used primary tecniques to adition, subtraction, divison and multiplication, for example: shepherds counted the herd of yours animals drawing lines in a piece of wood and the abacos maked in the ground that were used by babylon and romans. Over time with the developed of sciences has became necessary to do advanced calculations, improve the comunication and store of information, for this has created a lot of calculatores machines and the first computers. Below there are some topics and machines that was developed in the history of computer tecnology or "information tecnology (IT)".
      
  ### Silogisms:
  For understanded and define the logic conditional and conjunct theory was created the concept of Silogism, it's a logic expressions such as: "If all X are Y and all Y are Z, then all X are Z", don't matters what is X, Y and Z, the logic is true.

  ### Algorithms:
  To do adition and division of longers numbers the mathetic Abdullah Muhammad bin Musa al-Khwarizmi has developed a step by step, this procediment was named "Algorithm", over time this concept became a important topics of computer science called "Data structure and Algoritms", because the scientists saw that similar problems has a similar solutions and with the creation and analyse of algoritms could help to find the best solutions. 

  ### Criptography
  Although the term "criptography" has made in 1920 year, a lot of years before this the mathematic Al-Kindi (from Iraque) post a papper about decoding criptograph messages. In this texto he describe a method based in frequency of letters in a text. For example: in longs texts the letter "A" represent on average 14,63% of all letters, then if a simbol appear in this frequency have a great probability to be this letter.
  Over time this topic became a very important because is a efficient method to improve data security in information tecnology, many techniques was developed from simples as: substitute the letter by your next in alphabethic, to equations non linear for calculate the index position of a letter.  

  ### Automatos
  The word "automato" mean originaly describe a machine able to move without eletricity, especially that made actions that remember humans or animals, a famous example is in the movie "Hugo" based in the book "The invention of Hugo Cabret". In the theory of computer the aumatos is defined as matematic model of a machine of finite states, this topic is very import for study computational possibilities and complexity.
  
  ### Charles Babbage
  Borned in England at 1791 this cientist is known as a inventor that was project the first computer for generally use, made only with mechanical parts, named "Analytical Machine", this equipament were based in mechanical tear made by the frech Jacquard that were able to read drilled cards with instructions. Although of all their idea never was made because was necessity of techniques over advanced for that time. Over time some details of the project was lost, impossibility the done. 
  
  ### Ada Lovelace
  Interested in the idea of "Analytical Machine" this mathematic and writter english studied their operation and developed the first algoritms that allowed the machine compute the values of mathematic functions. She is know as "the first computer programmer".

  ### Herman Hollerit
  With the development of tecnology of drilleds cards this north-american employeer boost your use for registry and read informations about the populational census, for this he invented a machine able to read this card in BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) code, this invent became essentialy to input information in computers.  

  ### IBM
  The International Business Machine (IBM) appear at 1924 manufacturing mechanical machines of tabuletes with the model created by hollerit, won a big contract with EUA government for produce machines able to register informations about the american workers. After some years joined in industry of writter machines. Over time this company developed many products that the objective were purpose otimization daily tasks of other companies, at 1960 has launched your first eletronic computer named "RAMA 305", after this the company focused in developement of hardware and software for personal and enterprise computers. In the most recent years the IBM transformed your business model leaving of production of hardware and begans in the market of products of information tecnology, providing services for many big companies around the world.  

  ### Turing Machine
 This a teoric model of machine able to show a basic concept of computer operation, this has devoped when Alan Turing look a way of explain how to human reasoning execute mathematical calculus through of a formal system, he defined that consist on a serie of operation for transform numbers in a serie of states that move on by fixed rules up to result. The mechanism is compost of a device fixed in a moveable head that could go to left or right and able to write and erase symbols in a infinite tape, the tape is partitioned in equal parts, a control unit could read a list of instructions of what do, the part readed is named "state", the salphabetic of symbols should be finite. Few years after the publication of th papper that described this equipament the mathematic and scientists of computer defined: "any operation only can be execute by any computer if was abled executed by Turing Machine"
 
  ### Teste de Turing
  The "Turing Test" test the capicty of a machine of show a human inteligence, or indistinguishable this. The ilustrator example thinked by Turing is the situation: a human player join in a talk with other human and a machine, all players are so far among their, the humans makes questions, if they couldn't identify who replied,the machine was approved.  
 
  ### Eniac
  When the EUA join in the Second World War the American Army request to Moore School in Pensilvânia the work of calculate the trajectory of missils, this service generated tables with the information for each gun, however the manufactures produced many new models of guns and the manual work were very slow than they needs, the students John Machly and John Eckert began developed a project of eletronic machine able to execute this work very fast, it used eletronic valves to substitute the mechanical parts. This project named "ENIAC" was financed by Amarican Army but has done only in few months after the war, it were compost of 17.468 valves, 1500 relays, 70.000 resistors and 10.000 capacitors, stayed in a room of 10x15 meters, weighed 30 ton and your power consumption were 174 KW, this computer was could execute a calculus equivalent of the 50 mil people, a simple trajectory was calculated in 20 hours for a table calculator, 15 minutes for a differential analyzer, could be executed at 20 second by the ENIAC.
  
  ### Transistor
  The first computers used eletromechanic valves for compute, it were big and heavy, the transistor is a semiconductor device that fuction as eletronic valve can be control the voltage and current, it's a too small and light, through it became possible develope better computers. It's made mainly by silicon, this material gave name to principal place of developing of hardware and sorftware of world the "Silicon Valley".

  ### Myths of projects of software

  ### Management
  - Já temos um livro de suporte ao software, isto já não é o suficiente para os desenvolvedores?
  - Se o cronograma atrasar, poderemos acrescentar mais programadores e ficarmos em dia.
  - Terceirização é a melhor opção

  ### Clients
  - Uma definição geral dos objetivos é o suficiente
  - Os requisitos mudam continuamente, mas podem ser facilmente assimiladas.

  ### Software professionals
  - Uma vez feito o programa e colocado em uso, o trabalho está terminado.
  - Até que o programas entre em funcionamento, não há maneira de avaliar sua qualidade.
  - O único produto passível de entrega é o programa em funcionamento.
  - A eng. de software fará criação de documentação desnecessária.
